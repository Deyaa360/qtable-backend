# Backend Response to iOS Developer

## âœ… Table Assignment Support Implementation Complete

Your iOS app's table assignment functionality is now **fully supported** by the backend. All requested fields and endpoints have been implemented and tested.

## ðŸ“‹ Answers to Your Questions

### 1. Guest API Fields Support âœ…

**YES** - The `PUT /restaurants/{restaurant_id}/guests/{guest_id}` endpoint now accepts and stores ALL the new fields:

- âœ… `table_id` - Links guest to specific table
- âœ… `party_size` - Number of people in the party  
- âœ… `status` - Current guest status
- âœ… `check_in_time` - When guest checked in
- âœ… `seated_time` - When guest was seated
- âœ… `finished_time` - When guest finished dining
- âœ… `reservation_time` - Original reservation time

### 2. Status Values Support âœ…

**YES** - All your status values are supported:
- âœ… `"confirmed"`, `"arrived"`, `"seated"`, `"finished"`, `"cancelled"`, `"no_show"`, `"running_late"`, `"waitlist"`

### 3. Table API Format âœ…

**YES** - The table update format is correct and supports both naming conventions:

```json
{
  "status": "occupied",
  "currentGuestId": "guest-123"  // âœ… iOS camelCase supported
}
```

*OR*

```json
{
  "status": "occupied", 
  "current_guest_id": "guest-123"  // âœ… Snake_case also supported
}
```

### 4. Bidirectional Relationship âœ…

**YES** - The backend now automatically handles the bidirectional relationship:

- âœ… When guest gets `table_id: "table-123"`, table automatically gets `currentGuestId: "guest-123"`
- âœ… When table status changes to "occupied", guest status can be updated to "seated"
- âœ… Prevents conflicts (if table already has a guest, previous guest is moved to waitlist)
- âœ… You can still make both API calls for explicit control, or just update the guest

## ðŸ”§ Backend Implementation Details

### Updated Guest Response Format

The guest GET/PUT responses now include exactly what you requested:

```json
{
  "id": "guest-123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "firstName": "John", 
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "partySize": 4,
  "status": "seated",
  "tableId": "table-123",
  "reservationTime": "2025-08-14T19:30:00Z",
  "checkInTime": "2025-08-14T19:25:00Z", 
  "seatedTime": "2025-08-14T19:35:00Z",
  "finishedTime": null,
  "notes": "Some notes",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-14T18:00:00Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-08-14T19:35:00Z"
}
```

### Smart Relationship Management

When your iOS app calls:

```json
PUT /restaurants/{restaurant_id}/guests/{guest_id}
{
  "status": "seated",
  "table_id": "table-123", 
  "seated_time": "2025-08-14T19:35:00Z"
}
```

The backend automatically:
1. âœ… Updates guest with new table assignment
2. âœ… Sets table `currentGuestId` to the guest ID
3. âœ… Updates table status to "occupied"
4. âœ… Handles conflicts (moves previous guest to waitlist if table was occupied)

## ðŸš€ Ready for Testing

Your iOS app should now work perfectly with the backend:

1. âœ… **Display guests and tables** - All fields are properly returned
2. âœ… **Show guest status and table assignments** - Status and tableId fields included
3. âœ… **Handle swipe actions for status changes** - All status values supported
4. âœ… **Send complete guest data** - All fields accepted and stored
5. âœ… **Table assignment functionality** - Bidirectional relationship handled automatically

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Implementation

### Test Guest Assignment Flow:

1. **Create/Update Guest with Table:**
   ```
   PUT /restaurants/{restaurant_id}/guests/{guest_id}
   ```
   Send your complete guest data - it will work exactly as your iOS app expects.

2. **Verify Table Update:**
   ```
   GET /restaurants/{restaurant_id}/tables/{table_id}  
   ```
   The table should show `currentGuestId` automatically.

3. **Check Bidirectional Sync:**
   Update the same guest with a different `table_id` and verify the old table gets cleared.

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Notes

- **Flexible Field Names:** Backend accepts both `currentGuestId` (iOS camelCase) and `current_guest_id` (backend snake_case)
- **Automatic Timestamps:** `lastUpdated` fields are automatically maintained
- **Conflict Resolution:** If a table is already occupied, the previous guest is automatically moved to waitlist
- **Data Validation:** All timestamp fields accept ISO 8601 format as your iOS app sends

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Changed

- âœ… Guest model extended with table assignment fields
- âœ… Guest API endpoints updated to handle new fields
- âœ… Table API enhanced with bidirectional relationship sync
- âœ… Database migration applied
- âœ… Response schemas updated to match iOS expectations
- âœ… Smart conflict resolution for table assignments

## ðŸ”¥ Ready to Test!

The backend is now production-ready for your table assignment feature. Your iOS app should work exactly as designed without any changes needed on your end.

**Test away!** ðŸš€
